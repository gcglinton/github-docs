# Data Residency and Use of GitHub for Unclassified, Open-Source Code

---

## Introduction

This document explains the **data residency** requirements concerning the use of **GitHub.com** for hosting unclassified, open-source code. Based on the **Government of Canada’s "Guideline on Service and Digital"**, we assert that our use of GitHub for unclassified code is fully compliant, as data residency restrictions apply only to sensitive information such as Protected B, Protected C, or Classified data. Additionally, GitHub’s numerous certifications, including **SOC 3 compliance**, make it a secure and reliable platform for unclassified code.

The **Guideline on Service and Digital** can be referenced here: [Guideline on Service and Digital](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/guideline-service-digital.html).

## Data Residency Requirements

The **Government of Canada’s Guideline on Service and Digital** outlines data residency requirements for sensitive information. It mandates that **Protected B, Protected C, and Classified data** be stored within Canada or in Government of Canada-controlled facilities abroad to ensure legal and jurisdictional control.

However, **unclassified data**, such as open-source code, is **not subject to these residency restrictions**. The guideline allows for unclassified data to be processed and stored outside Canada, meaning external services like **GitHub** can be used without concerns about residency requirements for unclassified data.

## GitHub’s Certifications and Compliance

1. **SOC 3 Compliance**  
   GitHub.com Free-tier is **SOC 3 compliant**, which ensures that its systems are audited and verified for security, confidentiality, and availability controls. The **SOC 3 report** demonstrates GitHub's commitment to maintaining a secure environment for non-Enterprise customers like us, confirming the operating effectiveness of their security controls. This makes GitHub an ideal platform for unclassified, open-source code, ensuring that basic security standards are met and regularly audited.

2. **ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Certification**  
   GitHub is also certified for **ISO/IEC 27001:2013**, a globally recognized standard for information security management systems (ISMS). This certification underscores GitHub’s rigorous security processes and provides additional assurance that our data is being handled securely.

3. **CSA CAIQ Assessment**  
   GitHub completes the **Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ)**, which evaluates the cloud provider’s security measures against the **Cloud Control Matrix (CCM)**. This self-assessment demonstrates GitHub’s adherence to best practices in cloud security, further reinforcing its suitability for hosting unclassified data.

## Use of GitHub for Unclassified, Open-Source Code

1. **Unclassified and Publicly Available Information**  
   The code hosted on **GitHub** is both unclassified and open-source, meaning it is intended to be publicly accessible. As this information does not require strict security controls, data residency restrictions, which apply to sensitive information, are not relevant in this context.

2. **No Residency Restrictions for Unclassified Data**  
   In line with the **Guideline on Service and Digital**, **there are no geographic restrictions** for storing unclassified data. GitHub, with its global infrastructure, can securely handle unclassified data without violating any government policies on data residency.

3. **Certified Security for Unclassified Data**  
   GitHub’s **SOC 3 compliance**, **ISO/IEC 27001 certification**, and **CSA CAIQ** demonstrate that the platform follows robust security standards. While data residency restrictions do not apply to our unclassified data, GitHub’s commitment to security ensures that the data remains well-protected.

## Conclusion

Our use of **GitHub.com** for hosting unclassified, open-source code complies fully with the **Government of Canada’s data residency guidelines**. These guidelines make clear that data residency restrictions apply only to sensitive data, such as **Protected B, Protected C, or Classified** information. Since our code is **unclassified**, it is exempt from these restrictions.

In addition, GitHub’s certifications, including **SOC 3**, **ISO/IEC 27001:2013**, and **CSA CAIQ**, ensure that the platform adheres to internationally recognized security standards, making it a highly secure and suitable platform for hosting our unclassified, open-source project.
